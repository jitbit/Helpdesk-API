#### About Jitbit Helpdesk

Jitbit Helpdesk is a popular affordable support ticket system created by a small bootstrapped UK startup "Jitbit". The helpdesk app is available both as a "saas"-application and an "on-premise" solution that can be downloaded and installed on your local server.

The system is based on ASP.NET MVC and uses MS SQL Server to store the tickets. The API is a "restful" http service that can be used on both versions of the helpdesk ("hosted" and "onpremises").
